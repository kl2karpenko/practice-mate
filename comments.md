## Comments to HW:

### Header: 
- Main Menu is too close to the main table, it should have more padding on the bottom but it should be on the bottom baseline for left logo
- Try use less colspan in the table


### Center:
- "Ваша заявка принята." - this text is too far from top text - distance should me mush smaller and to the bottom text the same padding is too much
- Main table in the center should have grey border on the left and right
- Line with text "Beige Ukrainian scarf" has big font-size should be smaller all of them
- Table cells with description of product: 1 cell should be twice smaller width and right cell should be under "Beige Ukrainian scarf" text (look at the psd)


### Footer: 
- left and right text should be aligned to the top not to the middle
- font size of numbers should be bigger
- Social icons are different sizes? Should be exactly the same and distance between them should be smaller


### Structure:
- It will be better if you will not use sush a lot of colspan but use nesting tables inside
- Tag style should not be in the end of body it should be inside head tag
- It's better not to use styles outside, better use inline styles for all the maket
